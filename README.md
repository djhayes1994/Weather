# What is this?
This is just me messing around with Python trying to get a better understanding of working with APIs.

I'm also trying to get out of my comfort zone and start making use of functions/creating modules that can be called upon outside of the main script.

# How do I use it?

## Install/Running
Clone this repo and run the app.py application.

You will need to create a environment variable in your OS named:

openweather_apiKey

The value of this variable will need to be set to your OpenWeather API key.

You can get this from: https://openweathermap.org/api

## Expected inputs
You will be asked for a zip code, enter a 5 digit zip code.
